# Servo module

* Just like in Arduino, there's a Servo module you can use in Micropython
* It isn't installed by default
* I'm working on a way to flash it from the Chromebooks - for now, we'll copy and paste into your code
* Go to [the module](https://github.com/microbit-playground/microbit-servo-class)
* Follow the "Quick and easy" directions
